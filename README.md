# Python Workshop and Project
Welcome to my Python workshop and project repository! This repository contains the work I completed as part of a Python class. Here, you'll find various scripts, projects, 
and exercises that showcase my learning and development in Python programming.

## Introduction
This repository serves as a portfolio of the Python projects and exercises I completed during my Python class. The goal of the workshop was to enhance our understanding 
of Python programming by working on real-world projects and practical exercises.

## Projects
### 1. PigGame:
This project implements a Python-based dice game called "PigGame." In this game, players take turns rolling a die, accumulating points with each roll. 
However, if a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they score no points for that round. Players have the option to end their turn voluntarily, adding 
their current score to their total. The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds a total score of 50, upon which they are declared the winner. 
The code maintains the game's progress, tracks each player's total score, and announces the winner when the winning condition is met.

### 2. slotMachine:
This project presents a Python implementation of a slot machine game where players deposit money, place bets on multiple lines, and spin the reels to match symbols. 
The game features predefined symbol counts and values, along with limits on the number of lines and bet amounts. Players can spin the slot machine, and winnings are calculated based on 
matched symbols and bet amounts. The game continues until the player decides to quit, providing an interactive and entertaining gambling experience within the console.

### 3. linkedListCreation:
This code defines three classes: Student, Node, and LinkedList. The Student class represents a student with attributes name and cgpa, and a method toString() to convert the student object 
to a string. The Node class represents a node in a linked list, containing data of type Student and references to the next and previous nodes. The LinkedList class implements a doubly 
linked list, providing methods to push data to the front and back of the list, pop data from the front, and display the list from either the front or back. An example usage is provided 
at the end to demonstrate the functionality of the LinkedList class.

### 4. bankAccounts:
This code defines two classes: BalanceException and BankAccount. The BankAccount class represents a basic bank account with methods to get the balance, deposit money, withdraw money, 
and transfer money to another account. It also includes a custom exception BalanceException to handle cases where the balance is insufficient for a transaction. Additionally, there are
two subclasses: InterestRewardsAcct, which provides an account with a 5% interest reward on deposits, and SavingsAcct, which imposes a $5 fee on withdrawals. An example usage is provided 
at the end, demonstrating various banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and transfer between accounts, including instances of both basic accounts and specialized accounts.
